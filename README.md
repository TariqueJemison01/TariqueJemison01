# Tarique Jemison 🚀
**` Versatile Developer (Developer/Digital Artist/Global Citizen)`**

I'm a results-driven software engineer with a passion for creative troubleshooting and customer-centric solutions. With a foundation in Java, C#, JavaScript, and Python, coupled with experience in cutting-edge technologies like ReactJS, Spring Boot, AWS, and Azure, I thrive on tackling complex challenges head-on. I strongly believe in continuous improvement as perfection is a journey rather than a destination, and I am dedicated to evolving and refining my skills one step at a time.
